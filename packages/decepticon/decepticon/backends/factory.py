"""Backend factory — HTTP-transport sandbox builder.

The agent code shouldn't know how the sandbox is deployed; it just asks
for a sandbox object. ``build_sandbox_backend()`` returns an
``HTTPSandbox`` that talks to a sandbox daemon over HTTP, which works in
every deployment target Decepticon supports today:

  - Dev / local-docker: sandbox container exposes the FastAPI daemon
    on ``http://sandbox:9999`` over the shared ``sandbox-net`` network.
  - Per-VM silo plane: sandbox sibling container on the VM, daemon
    reachable on loopback.
  - Cloud Run pool plane: sandbox runs as a sidecar in the same
    Cloud Run revision, reachable on ``localhost:9999`` via the shared
    network namespace.

There is no longer a docker-exec transport: the previous DockerSandbox
path required mounting ``/var/run/docker.sock`` into the langgraph
container, which is a host-escape vector for any prompt-injection-driven
RCE inside the agent process. HTTP-only consolidates on a single tested
code path and keeps the sandbox blast radius bounded by the container
boundary + the ``sandbox-net`` network.

       sub-agent filesystem ops to the env sidecar instead of the run's own

       reach the right sandbox — the two diverged).

    ``config`` — an optional run ``RunnableConfig``. When provided its
    ``configurable.sandbox_url`` / ``sandbox_token`` take precedence over the
    ambient ``get_config()`` contextvar (see ``_resolve_endpoint``). Callers that
    hold the run's config explicitly (the filesystem middleware, which has
    ``runtime.config``) MUST pass it so filesystem ops reach the run's own
    per-engagement sandbox even inside a sub-agent, where the contextvar is not
    seeded.

    Returns the same ``HTTPSandbox`` instance for every call with the
    same ``(base_url, token)``. langgraph dev server invokes one factory
    per registered graph at startup; without a shared client each
    factory builds its own client + its own ``BackgroundJobTracker``,
    and the ``SandboxNotificationMiddleware`` instance held by each
    graph sees a different ``_jobs`` view than the bash tool actually
    registers against — completion notifications never reach the agent.
    Keying by ``(base_url, token)`` keeps tests that monkeypatch the env
    isolated and supports multi-tenant deployments where a shared process routes
    each run to a distinct per-engagement daemon.

    Endpoint resolution (see ``_resolve_endpoint``): the current run's
    LangGraph ``configurable.sandbox_url`` / ``sandbox_token`` win when
    present; otherwise ``SANDBOX_URL`` / ``SANDBOX_TOKEN`` apply.

    Returns:
        An ``HTTPSandbox`` instance pointed at the daemon URL.

    Env:
        SANDBOX_URL
            Base URL of the sandbox daemon. Default
            ``http://localhost:9999`` (sibling-container / sidecar

        SANDBOX_TOKEN
