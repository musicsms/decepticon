## Install

**Prerequisites**: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2. That's it.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurpleAILAB/Decepticon/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Then configure your API key and start:

```bash
decepticon config    # Set your Anthropic or OpenAI API key
decepticon           # Launch
```

## Try the Demo

No configuration needed — just Docker and an API key.

```bash
decepticon demo
```

Launches Metasploitable 2 as a target, loads a pre-built engagement, and runs the full kill chain automatically: port scan, service enumeration, vsftpd exploit, and post-exploitation.

## What is Autonomous Hacking?

Let's be honest. The "AI + hacking" space is exhausting.

Every other week, someone drops a demo: *"Look, GPT can run nmap!"* Cool. Then what? It either ends up as a party trick that no one actually uses in production — or worse, it crosses a line nobody should cross.

> *"So these AI hacking agents... if they're not illegal, what are they even for?"*

Fair question. Here's our answer.

**Autonomous Hacking** is the next evolution in offensive security. It's not about making hacking easier or more accessible. It's about making **real Red Team operations** executable at machine speed — with the rigor, documentation, and legal framework that separates professionals from script kiddies.

Traditional red teaming demands hundreds of hours of manual work — scanning, enumerating, pivoting, documenting — most of it repetitive, all of it exhausting. Meanwhile, the attack surface grows faster than any human team can cover.

Autonomous Hacking changes the equation. AI agents handle the grind: running scans, analyzing output, chaining techniques, and adapting in real time. The human sets the mission, defines the rules, and focuses on what machines still can't do — intuition, judgment, and creative thinking.

> *"Delegate the repetitive. Focus on the decisive."*

## "But wait — aren't you guys just the same?"

Great question. Short answer: **No.**

Here's the thing most people miss about offensive security — there's a massive difference between *hacking* and *Red Team Testing*.

Red Team Testing is a **regulated, authorized, professional discipline**. Before a single packet leaves the wire, there are documents. Agreements. Rules.

- **RoE (Rules of Engagement)** — Defines what you can and can't touch. Scope, timing, boundaries. Violate this and you're not a red teamer, you're a criminal.
- **OPPLAN (Operations Plan)** — The full mission plan. Objectives, kill chain phases, acceptance criteria. Every action maps to a purpose.
- **ConOps (Concept of Operations)** — Threat actor profile, attack methodology, the "who are we pretending to be" document.

**Decepticon supports all of this. Obviously.**

Every engagement starts with proper documentation. Every objective is tracked. Every action operates within defined boundaries. The agent doesn't just hack — it operates under a formal operations plan, respects the Rules of Engagement, and produces auditable findings.

This isn't a toy. It's a professional Red Team platform that happens to be autonomous.

## Why Decepticon?

Penetration testing finds vulnerabilities. Red teaming answers a harder question: *can your organization survive a real attack?*

Most security tools stop at the scan report. Decepticon doesn't. It thinks in kill chains — reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence — executing multi-stage operations the way a real adversary would, not the way a scanner does.

Three principles guide everything we build:

**Real Red Teaming, Not Checkbox Security**
Decepticon emulates actual adversary behavior — not just running CVE checks against a list of ports. It reads an operations plan, adapts to what it finds, and pursues objectives through whatever path opens up. The goal is to test your defenses the way they'll actually be tested.

**Complete Isolation**
Every command runs inside a hardened Kali Linux sandbox. No tools touch the host. No credentials leak. No accidental blast radius. You get the full offensive toolkit — nmap, metasploit, custom scripts — without the risk of running them on your own machine.

**CLI-First**
Security work belongs in the terminal. Decepticon's interface is a real-time streaming CLI built with Ink — no browser tabs, no dashboards, no context switching. You see what the agent sees, as it happens.

## The Bigger Picture: Offense Serves Defense

Here's what most "offensive AI" projects get wrong: they treat the attack as the destination.

**Decepticon is not the destination. It's Step 1.**

> There are already plenty of offensive AI agents out there. The world doesn't need another "look, AI can hack things" demo.

What the world actually needs is a system that turns offensive capabilities into **defensive evolution**. That's the real vision:

1. **Step 1 — Autonomous Offensive Agent**: Build a world-class hacking agent that executes realistic Red Team operations. *We are here.*
2. **Step 2 — Infinite Offensive Feedback**: Deploy the agent to generate continuous, diverse attack scenarios — an endless stream of real-world threat simulation.
3. **Step 3 — Defensive Evolution**: Channel that feedback into Blue Team capabilities — detection rules, response playbooks, hardening strategies. The defense evolves because the offense never stops.

Think of it as an **Offensive Vaccine**. Just as a biological vaccine exposes the body to weakened pathogens to build immunity, Decepticon exposes your infrastructure to relentless AI-driven attacks to build resilience.

The true value isn't in the attack. It's in the defense system that emerges from surviving it.

## Agents

Decepticon runs a **multi-agent system** where a central orchestrator delegates to specialist agents, each with its own tools, skills, and context window.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Decepticon** | Orchestrator. Reads the operations plan, coordinates the kill chain, delegates tasks to specialists. |
| **Recon** | Reconnaissance and enumeration. Runs scans, discovers services, maps attack surface inside the sandbox. |
| **Planner** | Document generation. Produces ConOps, operations plans, and rules of engagement from mission briefs. |
| **Exploit** | Exploitation. Attempts access through discovered vulnerabilities, credentials, or misconfigurations. |
| **Post-Exploit** | Post-exploitation. Privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, and data collection. |

Each agent spawns with a **clean context window** per objective — no accumulated noise, no degraded reasoning. Findings persist to disk, not to memory, so every iteration starts sharp.

## Vision & Philosophy

This README covers the essentials — but there's a deeper story behind why Decepticon exists, where it's headed, and the philosophy that drives every design decision.

**[Read the full vision and philosophy at docs.decepticon.red](https://docs.decepticon.red)**

Topics covered in the documentation:
- **Core Philosophy** — Reasoning over signatures, hybrid intelligence, stealth as foundation
- **Pentesting vs. Red Teaming** — Why the distinction matters and where Decepticon sits
- **History & Evolution** — From Purple Team AI (2021) through RL and GANs to today's autonomous agents
- **Target Architecture** — Multi-agent hybrid architecture, C2-based stealth execution
- **Why Open Source** — Collective intelligence and the Red/Blue Team feedback loop
