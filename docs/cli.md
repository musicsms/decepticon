## Interactive CLI

Once inside the CLI, you have two **screen modes**, a **graph sidebar** (overview/nodes/flows), and a set of slash commands.

**Prompt mode** (default) shows a compact view — sub-agent sessions are collapsed, consecutive tool calls are grouped, and only the latest bash output is expanded. **Transcript mode** (`ctrl+o`) expands everything: full event history, sub-agent details, and complete tool outputs. The right sidebar keeps the original execution-mode bar (`decepticon`, `soundwave`, `recon`, `exploit`, `postexploit`) and now adds a live knowledge-graph panel.

A local **Web Canvas** (Composer-style interactive SVG viewer) is started automatically. The URL appears in the sidebar under `Web Canvas`; open it in your browser to pan/zoom and inspect graph nodes while keeping the CLI workflow unchanged.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |

| `ctrl+g` | Cycle graph sidebar mode (overview → nodes → flows) |
| `ctrl+b` | Toggle graph sidebar visibility |

| `Esc` | Exit transcript mode |

### Slash Commands
